# **Hello, World!**

The files in this repository are used for my assignment for React Fundamentals, Module 11, Lesson 1.


Overview:

For this assignment I created a web page for Batman, the dark knight crusader against evil in the city of Gotham. I incorporated React, JavaScript 
XML, and CSS to design, create, and style the webpage. To do this I created individual JSX files with functions to display info by section of the 
web page. The web page includes a background image with overlaying text, a header section with the name 'Batman', an about section with details 
about who Batman is, and a contact footer at the bottom. 


Note to reviewer:
I used a background image with overlaying text on the whole body of the web page and styled the page to ensure all the text was overlaying the 
background image. I did this because I chose to design the page for Batman and I thought it would be cool to have the Batman sybmol as the 
background image.
