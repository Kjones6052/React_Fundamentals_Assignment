                As a young boy, I was horrified and traumatized when I watched my parents, Dr. Thomas and Martha Wayne, murdered with a gun by a 
                mugger named Joe Chill. I refused to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder my parents. This 
                event drove me to train my body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman.
